Nodes can take several forms, including handheld devices with integrated displays, compact Bluetooth-enabled units that interface with smartphones, or permanently installed high-power stations designed for wide-area coverage.</p> <p>Meshtastic is commonly used by hobbyists, outdoor enthusiasts operating beyond cellular coverage, and for emergency or resilient communications during network outages. Its decentralized architecture and low cost make it well suited as an educational platform for students.</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>SE Mesh Network</li> <li>Worldwide Mesh Map</li> </ul>"},{"location":"starting-guide/#how-does-it-work","title":"How does it work?","text":"<p>In North America, Meshtastic operates in the unlicensed 915 MHz ISM band. LoRa modulation enables long-range communication at very low power levels by trading data rate for sensitivity and range. Payload sizes are typically limited to 256 bytes per message.</p> <p>The maximum permitted effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) in this band is +30 dBm (1 W PEP), or +36 dBm EIRP when accounting for antenna gain. Operating outside of these limits is strictly prohibited by the FCC.</p> <p>Meshtastic supports multiple radio presets, ranging from short-range, high-bandwidth modes to long-range, low-bandwidth configurations. The most commonly used open-channel preset is Long / Fast (1.07 kbps, 250 kHz), which balances throughput and coverage and is the default configuration.</p> <p>Nodes form a self-healing mesh network by rebroadcasting messages. A configurable hop limit controls how many times a packet may be relayed, allowing the network to scale while limiting congestion and signal degradation.</p> <p>Channels such as LongFast are encrypted using AES-256 (CTR mode) with a pre-shared channel key. Direct messages use public/private key pairs for end-to-end encryption. Messages are cryptographically signed, allowing recipients to verify the sender\u2019s identity. Packet headers remain unencrypted to support routing and rebroadcasting.</p> <p>Optionally, Meshtastic supports MQTT bridging, which tunnels mesh traffic over the internet. This allows geographically separated mesh networks to interconnect, at the cost of relying on grid infrastructure.</p>"},{"location":"starting-guide/#why-should-you-get-involved","title":"Why should you get involved?","text":"<p>Building a Meshtastic node offers a hands-on introduction to microcontrollers, radio frequency (RF) technology, and even 3D printing.

WisBlock boards are modular, allowing you to mix and match cores, radios, sensors, and power modules, and they can be ordered in different sizes to fit your enclosure and use case. This platform is especially well-suited for Meshtastic due to its ease of use, expandability, and long-term flexibility.</p> <p>Another strong option is Heltec, which offers complete LoRa development boards with integrated OLED displays, higher TX/RX power, and a more traditional all-in-one design. These are ideal if you want a powerful node with minimal assembly.</p> <p>For stationary or infrastructure mesh nodes, consider solutions like the Heltec Meshtower or comparable RAK-based solar enclosures. These systems are designed for long-term deployment and typically include: - Solar charging - Battery support - Weatherproof enclosures - Higher-gain external antennas for increased coverage</p>"},{"location":"starting-guide/#order-parts","title":"Order Parts","text":"<p>After selecting your configuration, order all required components, including:</p> <ul> <li>Battery (appropriate chemistry and capacity)</li> <li>Antenna with the correct connector</li> <li>Power switch</li> <li>Mounting hardware (screws, standoffs, enclosure)</li> <li>Optional accessories, such as sensors, GPS modules, or displays</li> </ul> <p>\u26a0\ufe0f Important: Verify your antenna cable and connector type before ordering.
