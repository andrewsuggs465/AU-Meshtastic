Place images you want to serve with the site in this folder.

Usage:

- Add files to `docs/images/` (e.g. `docs/images/team.jpg`).
- Reference them in Markdown as `![](/images/team.jpg)` or `![](images/team.jpg)`.
- Keep filenames lowercase and use hyphens for readability.

This folder is intentionally inside `docs/` so MkDocs will publish the images automatically.
