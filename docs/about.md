## Project-Based Learning
The main goal of the Auburn University Meshtastic club is simply to promote learning through Meshtastic. Although the club is centered around this technology, we want to be a basis for students to explore further
learniing opportunities such as research and group projects.
We aim to partner with professors and other clubs to accomplish their goals as well as build a positively constructive learning environment.

## Community Outreach
We plan to do tabling on the Haley Concourse and E-day. Additionally, doing outreach in the local Auburn/Opelika area to teach and educate people about Meshtastic is a long-term goal
